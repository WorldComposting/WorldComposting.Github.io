I started composting my first compost pile in 1995 as a way to reuse the grass clippings from my yard.  I also included many branches and food scraps in this pile and was amazed at how it would heat up and eventually I would have a rich dark compost.  After moving to a new house in 2007 I found that the yard did not have a place for a compost pile.  I started researching on how else I could stop throwing away food scraps and came upon Vermicomposting or composting with Red Worms.  In 2011 I finally put a plan into place and have been using Red Worms to create vermicompost ever since.  This website and YouTube channel show what I'm doing and will hopefully give others the courage to start composting as well!
