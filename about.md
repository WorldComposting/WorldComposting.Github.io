## About our Site

I started composting when I was around 10 years old.  I  started mowing my parents yard and realized that we were throwing out all of these clippings every week in the trash.  As we had extra space in the yard we started a compost pile for these clippings.  We did start adding some food scraps and other things but during the winter we would stop.

  As most kids do I eventually moved out and had a home of my own but my first home was a townhome and I had no place to build a compost pile which is when I started looking into vermicomposting.  This would allow me to compost in the house and also compost during the winter without having to go outside.

Today I now compost almost entirely in the house.  I mulch the lawn so I don't have grass clippings and compost food scraps (veggies and fruits) inside using red worms.
