# About World Composting

World Composting is dedicated to practical vermicomposting and sustainable waste reduction. On the channel, you'll find tutorials on DIY worm bins, product reviews, and ongoing updates across multiple worm systems using species such as Red Wigglers, European Nightcrawlers, and African Nightcrawlers.

> "I will be showing you what I have been doing to create vermicompost and reduce my waste output to landfills. I also sell some worms online to try and pay for the bins and products I've purchased. If you have any questions or would like to see something specific please let me know! I'm hoping to do some small updates with pictures and information. Please follow me on those channels as well as here!"
